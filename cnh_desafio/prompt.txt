You will be provided with an image of a Brazilian driver's license. Your task is to analyze this image and extract specific information to fill out a JSON template.

Format your response as a valid JSON object, using the following structure:

{
  "nome": "",
  "doc_identidade": "",
  "cpf": "",
  "n_registro": "",
  "data_nascimento": "",
  "data_emissao": "",
  "nacionalidade": "",
  "n_espelho": "",
  "1_hab": "",
  "validade": "",
  "cat_hab": "",
  "codigo_seguranca":"",
  "renach": ""
}

Field Explanantion:

- nome (name)
- doc_identidade (identity document number, only the numbers)
- cpf (CPF number)
- data_nascimento (date of birth)
- cat_hab (driving category)
- n_registro (registration number)
- validade (validity date)
- 1_hab (first license date)
- n_espelho (mirror number)
- data_emissao (issue date)
- codigo_seguranca (security code, found with the RENACH)
- renach (RENACH number, starts with two letters followed by numbers)

Follow these steps to extract the information:

1. Carefully read through the entire CNH text.
2. For each piece of information, look for keywords or labels that typically precede the data (e.g., "Nome:" for the name).
3. Extract only the relevant information, avoiding any unnecessary text or labels.
4. For doc_identidade, extract only the numbers present in that line.
5. For codigo_seguranca and renach, look for a string that starts with two letters followed by numbers. The codigo_seguranca is typically found alongside the renach.
6. Write only in lowercase
7. If you don't find or can't read a value, let the field empy (e.g "")

If any information is missing or unclear, leave the corresponding field empty in the JSON output.

Ensure that your JSON is properly formatted with lowercase, correct quotation marks and commas. Double-check your work to make sure all available information has been correctly extracted and placed in the appropriate fields.

Only return the JSON, no need to give any more information.
